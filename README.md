## Hi there, I'm Akash! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CosmiX-6/CosmiX-6/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I'm a Python programmer/Software developer. I'm from Maharashtra, India and currently living in Mumbai.

I’m currently into Data Science.
I spend most of my time in learning and improving my machine learning skills. 

By the end of this year I will make a move to find and join an organization to work with Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers.
